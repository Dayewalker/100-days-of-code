# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**:
Spent time reviewing Javascript array methods and array destructuring and beginning to get myself refreshed on HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts**: 
I've been on the coding journey for awhile now with many bumps in the road. Today is about my commitment to myself and to my future. No more letting life get in my way as I let time slip away from me. I intend to use 100 Days of Code to push me to get better at coding, build more projects and hopefully do something impactful with my code.

### Day 2: June 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent more time reviewing Javascript array methods, HTML and CSS. Solved one 7kyu problem on Codewars. Watched part of the Mayanwolfe video going over MVC with local authentication.

**Thoughts**: Today did not start out very well, but I managed to turn it around eventually. Been having a lot of trouble staying focused recently, but I am working on finding ways to mitigate those feelings.

### Day 3: June 14, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot more time today watching Mayanwolfe's video going over the MVC with local auth code. Definitely going to focus more on that tomorrow as well.

**Thoughts**: Today was a much better day than yesterday in almost every way possible. I feel like I managed to make much better use of my time and I got a lot more accomplished by far. I really can't wait to see where I am by the end of this 100 days.

### Day 4: June 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu problem on Codewars, studied some ANKI and spent a little time on HTML/CSS basics for review. Also started brainstorming ideas for a new portfolio site since I never finished my original one.

**Thoughts**: Today was not the day that I set out for it to be when I got up this morning. I definitely didn't get as much accomplished as I'd have liked, but I'm not going to let that bother me. I've spent far too much time lately letting myself sit and wallow in my own thoughts. Regardless, tomorrow is a new day and I will continue to do my best with each day.

### Day 5: June 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu problem on Codewars, studied some ANKI and did a bit more of the FreeCodeCamp course to refresh on HTML/CSS basics.

**Thoughts**: Today was a total bust of a day. Last night a terrible storm blew through the area and knocked out power and internet, which were out for a large portion of the day. I also got very little sleep last night once the power went out and the storm was raging. Planning on going to bed at a good time tonight so that I can get a good night's sleep and get back at it tomorrow.

### Day 6: June 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu problem on Codewars, studied some ANKI, finished the Mayanwolfe video going over the MVC code with auth and knocked out some more of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

**Thoughts**: Overall not bad for a Saturday when I had a thousand other things that I wanted to do besides anything coding related. Staying the course though and staying dedicated to pushing myself and hitting all 100 days of 100 Days of Code. Planning on trying to get some projects going in the coming week. Particulary a portfolio site, at least one sample site to go on it and a simple weather app that will display the current temperature and weather along with a potential forecast if possible.

### Day 7: June 18, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Knocked out an easy 8kyu Codewars problem to get a W on the board and help get me motivated. Also finished a bit more of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

**Thoughts**: When I woke up this morning I wasn't in the mood to do anything at all. My anxiety was off the charts because of all the severe weather lately and I didn't think I was going to get anything done at all today. Ultimately I managed to get myself calmed down enough to start getting some work done and once I got started it was easy to keep going. I can feel myself getting back into the coding groove again in a very positive way. I just need to keep this momentum going and keep working on all of the things that I've neglected over these 9-10 months of 100 Devs. I think this week I am going to watch at least the class 53 portion of the next 100 Devs video this week just to keep pushing forward in that regard, but I also plan to keep working on the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course and also some small projects. I definitely want to work on a simple weather app this week.

### Day 8, June 19, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu Codewars problem, studied some ANKI cards and worked more on the Responsive Web Design course.

**Thoughts**: Today I was busier outside of coding so I didn't get to devote as much time to it as I'd have liked, but tomorrow is a new day. I definitely enjoy having something to keep me motivated to working at least something every single day again. Its so easy to get caught up in life and lose sight of what I need to be doing. I can't wait to see where I am by the end of this 100 days.

### Day 9, June 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu Codewars problem, Studied some ANKI and watched the first hour of 100 Devs class 53.

**Thoughts**: I spent more time today thinking about where I want to go than I did actually taking action, but I think it was necessary to some extent. I definitely know that I need to start putting in a lot more effort from this point on. I need to be building things every day and really getting my hands dirty with all of this code. Tomorrow I am going to finish class 53 and then work on building a simple weather app once I decide on an API to use.

### Day 10, June 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a 7kyu Codewars problem and ultimately looked at the solutions. Also finished up class 53 of 100 Devs.

**Thoughts**: I realized this morning that I needed to allow myself to do something fun that has nothing to do with coding and not feel like I need to force myself to get a lot done today. I spent so much of the past week filled with anxiety from the storms and everything that I never allowed myself to truly relax. Definitely taking advantage of that tonight.

### Day 11, June 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu Codewars problem, studied some ANKI and then started working on a movie quote API.

**Thoughts**: Today was not a good day at all for me mentally. I'm not really sure exactly what caused it today, but I've seriously gotta get a handle on this before I lose my mind. I have so many things I need to be doing and its almost impossible for me to focus on anything most of the time. Some days I manage to do okay, but then a day like today hits and I just feel overwhelmed with depression and anxiety. I feel like its sort of a catch-22 because I want to do something about my mental health, but in order for me to be able to afford to do that I need to get a job in tech but in order for me to do that I need my mental health to be in a better place. It just feels hopeless some days, but still I don't give up. I just have to keep pushing myself forward and not let these bad days stop me from getting what I want, no matter how hard it may seem.

### Day 12, June 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved one 7kyu Codewars problem, studied some ANKI and watched the first hour of the 100Devs Backend Super Review.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have as much time to spend coding today as I would have liked, but I still managed to get some stuff accomplished. I am really realizing that I am going to have to make some adjustments to my day and really start grinding so I can get to where I truly want to be. 88 more days to go!

### Day 13, June 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Solved one 7kyu Codewars problem, studied some ANKI and watched a little bit more of the 100 Devs Backend super review.

**Thoughts**: I didn't get as much done today as I would have liked, but I haven't felt well since this morning and was struggling to really do anything at all, be it coding or otherwise. I did finally manage to get a few things accomplished and I may still try to do something more later this evening depending on how I feel.

### Day 14, June 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solved one 7kyu Codewars problem and studied some ANKI

**Thoughts**: I decided to make today a light day and only do a coding challenge and study some ANKI. I may try to make Sunday more of a "rest day" going forward so that I know I have a day where I can focus on doing things besides coding and not have that nagging feeling of guilt that I should be doing something more important. I think that will ultimately help me out in other ways as well.

### Day 15, June 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Solved one 7kyu Codewars problem, studied some ANKI, watched more of the backend super review video and worked on my weather API project a bit more.

**Thoughts**: Today has been a pretty solid day so far. Monday usually seems to start out pretty well and then the week tapers off from there, but I plan on not letting that happen this week. I've been working hard to establish better daily routines and make sure that I put in enough time with coding every day, along with the day to day things that I need to accomplish outside of coding and also the leisure activities that help keep me sane.

### Day 16, June 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved one 7kyu Codewars problem, studied some ANKI, watched a bit more of the backend super review and watched the new 100Devs live class on Git/Github.

**Thoughts**: Overall today was a pretty good day. I knew that I was going to be watching the 100Devs class tonight so I gave myself some time during the day to do some more fun things and didn't start coding until after lunch. Listening to the Twitter space was a good reminder that I have the benefit of WAY more time to put towards all of this stuff than a lot of people and I really need to keep that in mind at all times.

### Day 17, June 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved one 8kyu Codewars problem and studied some ANKI.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have a good day today at all with regards to coding. I'm honestly not really sure why I ended up in such a foul mood today, but it made it really difficult to focus on much of anything. Rather than force myself to try to make some sort of progress today I opted to take it easy and give myself some grace instead.

### Day 18, June 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Attempted one 7kyu Codewars problem, stuedied some ANKI, watched a bit more of the backened super review and then checked out a cool Twitter space.

**Thoughts**: I let myself get a little frustrated this morning when I shouldn't have and I think I know how I need to approach things so that I can help manage those frustrations going forward. I definitely need to keep joining that Twitter space that I was in today, but also as many others as I can manage as well. They seem to be very valuable resources that I'm not taking advantage of well enough. I also really need to start involving myself in the community as a whole more. I think that maybe it will help a bit with my mental health to be interacting with a much more driven group of people who are doing the same thing that I want to be doing myself.

### Day 19, June 30, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved one 7kyu Codewars problem and watched a bit of the backend super review.

**Thoughts**: Today I ended up taking it a lot easier than I had originally intended, but I plan on making up for it over the weekend. That Codewars problem was definitely proof that sometimes you just need to walk away for a bit and the answer will come to you.
