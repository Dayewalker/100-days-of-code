# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**:
Spent time reviewing Javascript array methods and arrau destrictiring and beginning to get myself refreshed on HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts**: 
I've been on the coding journey for awhile now with many bumps in the road. Today is about my commitment to myself and to my future. No more letting life get in my way as I let time slip away from me. I intend to use 100 Days of Code to push me to get better at coding, build more projects and hopefully do something impactful with my code.

### Day 2: June 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent more time reviewing Javascript array methods, HTML and CSS. Solved one 7kyu problem on Codewars. Watched part of the Mayanwolfe video going over MVC with local authentication.

**Thoughts**: Today did not start out very well, but I managed to turn it around eventually. Been having a lot of trouble staying focused recently, but I am working on finding ways to mitigate those feelings.

### Day 3: June 14, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot more time today watching Mayanwolfe's video going over the MVC with local auth code. Definitely going to focus more on that tomorrow as well.

**Thoughts**: Today was a much better day than yesterday in almost every way possible. I feel like I managed to make much better use of my time and I got a lot more accomplished by far. I really can't wait to see where I am by the end of this 100 days.

### Day 4: June 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu problem on Codewars, studied some ANKI and spent a little time on HTML/CSS basics for review. Also started brainstorming ideas for a new portfolio site since I never finished my original one.

**Thoughts**: Today was not the day that I set out for it to be when I got up this morning. I definitely didn't get as much accomplished as I'd have liked, but I'm not going to let that bother me. I've spent far too much time lately letting myself sit and wallow in my own thoughts. Regardless, tomorrow is a new day and I will continue to do my best with each day.

### Day 5: June 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu problem on Codewars, studied some ANKI and did a bit more of the FreeCodeCamp course to refresh on HTML/CSS basics.

**Thoughts**: Today was a total bust of a day. Last night a terrible storm blew through the area and knocked out power and internet, which were out for a large portion of the day. I also got very little sleep last night once the power went out and the storm was raging. Planning on going to bed at a good time tonight so that I can get a good night's sleep and get back at it tomorrow.

### Day 6: June 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7kyu problem on Codewars, studied some ANKI, finished the Mayanwolfe video going over the MVC code with auth and knocked out some more of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.

**Thoughts**: Overall not bad for a Saturday when I had a thousand other things that I wanted to do besides anything coding related. Staying the course though and staying dedicated to pushing myself and hitting all 100 days of 100 Days of Code. Planning on trying to get some projects going in the coming week. Particulary a portfolio site, at least one sample site to go on it and a simple weather app that will display the current temperature and weather along with a potential forecast if possible.
